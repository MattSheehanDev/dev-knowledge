Docker Setup
======================

1. Download Docker for Windows
    - https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/
    - You probably have to reboot after installation
    - Docker will start with your machine, you'll need to login
    - Check to make sure it installed with `docker --version`
    - Make sure you right-click the docker windows service and select `Switch to Windows containers` if you're not already using windows containers if you are building windows containers, otherwise make sure the docker service is set to linux containers

2. The [Getting started with Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/) is good for getting an overview

3. It's worth installing the Visual Studio Tools for Docker
    - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/docker/visual-studio-tools-for-docker
