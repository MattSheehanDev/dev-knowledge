### Keyboard

macOS keyboards have a few different buttons than other PC keyboards.
- `Cmd` (⌘) is equal to the Windows key (⊞). On Linux it is sometimes called the Super key.
- `Option` (⌥) is equal to the Windows Alt key. The right-side Alt key is sometimes used as the `Meta` key for some applications (ex. Emacs).
