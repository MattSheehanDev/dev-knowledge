Table Metadata
=========================

List all database tables
```
SELECT
    schema_name(t.schema_id) as schema_name,
    t.name as table_name,
    t.create_date,
    t.modify_date
FROM sys.tables t
ORDER BY schema_name, table_name;
```

Table storage space
```
-- Multiply UnusedSpaceKB by 8 because a page in sqlserver is eight KB's
--
SELECT 
    s.Name AS SchemaName,
    t.NAME AS TableName,
    p.rows AS RowCounts,
    SUM(a.total_pages) * 8 AS TotalSpaceKB, 
    SUM(a.used_pages) * 8 AS UsedSpaceKB, 
    (SUM(a.total_pages) - SUM(a.used_pages)) * 8 AS UnusedSpaceKB
FROM 
    sys.tables t
INNER JOIN 
    sys.schemas s ON s.schema_id = t.schema_id
INNER JOIN      
    sys.indexes i ON t.OBJECT_ID = i.object_id
INNER JOIN 
    sys.partitions p ON i.object_id = p.OBJECT_ID AND i.index_id = p.index_id
INNER JOIN 
    sys.allocation_units a ON p.partition_id = a.container_id
WHERE 
    t.NAME NOT LIKE 'dt%'    -- filter out system tables for diagramming
    AND t.is_ms_shipped = 0
    AND i.OBJECT_ID > 255 
GROUP BY 
    t.Name, s.Name, p.Rows
ORDER BY 
    UsedSpaceKB DESC
