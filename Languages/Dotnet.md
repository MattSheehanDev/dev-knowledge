### Setup

Install SDK
```
brew cask install dotnet-sdk
```

The Dotnet versioning can seem a little weird sometimes.
- There is the release version which usually matches the Runtime version, and then there is the SDK version which usually has a different version than the release and certain SDK's are versioned based off of what version of Visual Studio they are for.
- If you are not using Visual Studio, use the latest SDK version.
